    <P>Qiessence is dedicated to the the raising of consciousness, individual wholeness and balance by sharing honored and proven healing modalities. Your facilitator, Karen Soriano, has been involved with various healing techniques for the past 25 years, specializing in Sound Healing and Qigong. A professional musician, Karen's graduate studies were in Ethnomusicology at Indiana University, Bloomington. Studying energy medicine and spirituality, Karen has obtained much of her training from authentic healers and masters from all over the world representing many traditions and schools of thought.  Karen received permission to conduct Om Healing Circles with the blessing of Mahavatar Babaji, making it a most powerful healing experience for all. <a href="http://www.omqiessence.com" target="_blank">www.omqiessence.com</a></P>
    <P>"Om Love in Action" is a unified global intention for opening all hearts to Love.  You are invited to a most powerful and time honored tradition of OM Healing Circles to unveil the very essence that connects us.  Om, the greatest of all mantras and the sound of creation, mystically embodies the essence of the entire universe.  Chanting Om with a focused purpose is like a laser of refined healing energy drawing from the highest frequencies of Unconditional Love.</p>
    <P>Everything is Vibration. Chanting OM contributes to healing by raising the vibratory rate, encouraging balance and well-being. When you create an atmosphere around an individual of a certain frequency that represents their ideal healthful state, then their cellular structure can begin to identify with that, rather than continuing to identify with the vibrational frequency of the disease. Om has for centuries connected spiritual and physical dimensions inspiring contact with higher realms and beings. We begin and end with the breath and the OM is the audible breath unifying the totality of All.  Chanting OM empowers and aligns while releasing imbalanced energies and their symptoms.</p>
    <p>The OM Healing tradition is an ancient form of healing from India that utilizes the power of OM for healing on all levels of being. Through the blessings of Mahavatar Babaji, this specific ritual brings back the healing ability to the individual. We simply chant OM continuously with purposeful intent while taking turns in the middle of the circle, simultaneously opening our hearts, raising consciousness and uplifting global concerns. When complete, we may share our experiences with one another.</p>

        <p>This is a basic introduction of the simple 4-step NVC Nonviolent Communication process and progresses to an in depth understanding of its philosophy and its powerful applications as a profound tool for generating peace on earth through respectful and self-responsible communicating. </p>
        
        <p>Also referred to as compassionate or empathic communication, its purpose is to inspire compassion from others & to respond compassionately to others & thereby enhance the possibility for true connection on a human level.</p>
        
        <p>NVC guides us to reframe how we EXPRESS ourselves & how we HEAR others without shaming / blaming / judging or criticizing and instead by focusing on what we are observing, feeling, needing and requesting.</p>
        
        <p>How will this course "inspire the path of health" in your life?</p>
        
        <p>The POWER of language cannot be underestimated…how we hold in our minds our experience of reality (the words we think) & then share that understanding outwards (with the words we say) … will impact and sometimes even create our experiences of reality!!</p>
        
        <p>Learning to use words in a <b>conscious</b> and responsible way i.e. compassionate to ourselves and others will generate a more peaceful & harmonious experience of our inner and outer worlds!!</p>

        <p>It is our Earthly birthright to live an existence of harmony, love, abundance and personal power.  Our original blueprint gave us DNA structure to know ourselves as Beings of great manifesting powers combined with the understanding that we are always connected to Source, that we are capable of monumental love and compassion, that we ARE always an experience of SPIRIT.</p>

        <p>The conscious illusion is fear, lack, struggle, pain, aloneness…Our truth is love, abundance, effortlessness, health, oneness.</p>

        <p>We are energetically postured for huge transition…our time to become Beings of Light, Beings of Love, Beings of Compassion, Beings of Oneness is NOW.</p>

        The forum for this class is open discussion with time for Q & A.<br />
        <b><u>In this event you will also:</u></b><br />
        <ul>
            <li>Experience your elevated state</li>
